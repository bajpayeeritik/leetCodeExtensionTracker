# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Design**: Simple, recognizable design that represents coding/session tracking
- **Colors**: Should work well on both light and dark themes
- **Style**: Modern, clean design that fits Chrome's aesthetic

## Placeholder Icons

Since actual icon files are not included in this repository, you'll need to:

1. **Create your own icons** using an image editor
2. **Use online icon generators** like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
3. **Download free icons** from sites like flaticon.com or icons8.com

## Quick Icon Creation

For development purposes, you can create simple placeholder icons:

1. Use any image editing software (GIMP, Photoshop, Canva)
2. Create a square canvas (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
3. Add a simple symbol like:
   - Code brackets `{ }`
   - Clock or timer icon
   - Play/pause button
   - Graph or chart symbol
4. Export as PNG with transparency
5. Save with the appropriate filename

## Testing

Once you have the icons:
1. Place them in this `icons/` directory
2. Reload the extension in Chrome
3. Verify the icons appear correctly in the toolbar and extensions page
